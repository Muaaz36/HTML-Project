# HTML-Project
A basic website highlighting the skills I have learned recently in HTML and CSS. Website features a Mario Club with dummy text, link to other site pages, an email subscription dialogue box, and image gallery with animations. The website is also compatible with smaller viewport sizes, therefore it displays properly on mobile devices as well
